This is a fork of the ORIGINAL PyTyle (http://github.com/BurntSushi/pytyle1),
changed to work with Python 3.

PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
to be embedded into EWMH window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
the basic tiling features of XMonad- even down to the key bindings.

It should, in theory, work with any window manager complying with the EWMH
standards.
